## Welcome to my page on GitHub

In the following files there are few lines of code I used for my master, PhD, etc 

1. [Average photon at mixing chamber](https://github.com/sciglio/QuantumPotes/blob/master/Photon%20line%20population%20in%20an%20attenuated%20coaxial%20line.ipynb): Jupyter notebook for calculating the expected average photon occupation number in coaxial line of a diluition refrigerator. ![Mixing Chamber average photons](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sciglio/QuantumPotes/master/photons.png)

2. [Plotter for Microwave Pulses](https://github.com/sciglio/QuantumPotes/blob/master/Pulses_plotter.ipynb): Jupyter notebook for visualizing pulses on different channels. ![Plot visualization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sciglio/QuantumPotes/master/Pulses.png)
